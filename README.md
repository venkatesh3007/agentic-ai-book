## About

This book documents a 31-day sprint where I built one product per day using an AI agent (Claude/Jarvis running on OpenClaw) as my only engineering team. Every chapter is a real day with real code, real struggles, and real shipped products.

It's written in the open. You're watching the book get written in real-time.
