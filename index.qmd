# 31 Days. 31 Products. One AI Agent. {.unnumbered}

**📍 Current Status: February 23, 2026 — Pre-Sprint Setup Phase**

This book is a real-time record of my attempt to build a software company using AI agents as the primary engineering team.

**The Plan**: From March 1 to March 31, 2026, build one product every day. My only engineering resource is an AI agent named Jarvis — Claude running on OpenClaw, talking to me through Telegram, with access to my servers, my code, and my deployment pipelines.

**What you're reading**: A work-in-progress book that gets updated daily as the work happens. No retrospective storytelling. No post-hoc analysis. Just real events documented as they occur.

**Part I** covers the setup period (February 2026) — getting the agent running, solving the first real problems, and preparing for the sprint.  
**Part II** will cover each of the 31 days (starting March 1).  
**Part III** will capture the patterns and lessons (written as they emerge).

## Who This Book Is For

- Developers who want to understand how to work with AI agents on real projects
- Founders who want to see what "AI-native" means in practice, not in theory
- Anyone who wants an honest account of what works and what does not

## How to Read This Book (Work in Progress)

**Part I** (available now) should be read in order. It explains the tools, the setup, and the context for the 31-day sprint.

**Part II** (starting March 1) will be written daily as each product is built. Each day will be a self-contained story.

**Part III** (written as patterns emerge) will capture lessons and insights as they become clear.
