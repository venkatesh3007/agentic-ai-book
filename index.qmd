# 31 Days. 31 Products. One AI Agent. {.unnumbered}

This is not a book about AI theory.

This is a journal. A real-time record of what happened when I decided to build a software factory — from scratch, in 31 days — with an AI agent as my co-founder.

Every product in this book was actually shipped. Every failure actually happened. Every timestamp is real. The commit hashes link to real code on GitHub.

I wrote this book the same way I built the products: with an AI agent. His name is Jarvis. He's my Chief of Staff, my pair programmer, and occasionally my therapist when deploys fail at 2 AM.

## Who This Book Is For

- **Developers** who want to build with AI agents, not just read about them
- **Founders** who want to see what "AI-native" actually looks like in practice
- **Anyone** who's curious what happens when you stop treating AI as a chatbot and start treating it as a teammate

## How to Read This Book

Each day is self-contained. You can read them in order (recommended) or jump to whatever product interests you.

Every chapter follows the same structure:

- **The Goal** — what we're building today
- **The Build** — real-time narrative with code, decisions, and struggles
- **The Ship** — what we actually delivered
- **The Lesson** — what I learned (often the hard way)

The code is real and open source. Fork it. Break it. Build on it.
