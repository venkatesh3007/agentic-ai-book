# 31 Days. 31 Products. One AI Agent. {.unnumbered}

This book is a record of what happened when I tried to build a software company using AI agents as the primary engineering team.

From March 1 to March 31, 2026, I built one product every day. My only engineering resource was an AI agent named Jarvis — Claude running on OpenClaw, talking to me through Telegram, with access to my servers, my code, and my deployment pipelines.

Some products shipped cleanly. Some broke in production. Some taught me things I did not expect to learn. All of them are documented here with real code, real timestamps, and real commit hashes.

Part I covers the setup period in February 2026 — getting the agent running, solving the first real problems, and preparing for the sprint. Part II covers each of the 31 days. Part III covers the patterns and lessons that emerged.

## Who This Book Is For

- Developers who want to understand how to work with AI agents on real projects
- Founders who want to see what "AI-native" means in practice, not in theory
- Anyone who wants an honest account of what works and what does not

## How to Read This Book

Part I should be read in order. It explains the tools, the setup, and the context you need to understand the 31-day sprint.

Part II can be read in any order. Each day is a self-contained story about building one product.

Part III is a summary of what I learned. Read it after at least a few days from Part II, so the patterns make sense.

The code is open source. Every repository is linked in the relevant chapter. You can read the code, fork it, or use it as a starting point for your own projects.
