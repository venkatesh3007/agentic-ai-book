title: "Preface"

I have been building software for years. In early 2026, I started a company called Aikaara with a specific thesis: every company will need its own software factory, and there is an opportunity to build the machine that builds those factories.

The problem was that I had a thesis and no products. I needed to build things fast, and I did not have a team.

So I set up an AI agent — Claude running on an open-source platform called OpenClaw — and gave it access to my infrastructure. I named it Jarvis and gave it the title of Chief of Staff. Then I started building.

This book documents what happened. The setup period in February, and then the 31-day sprint in March where I built one product every day using the agent as my only engineering team.

I wrote this book for two reasons:

First, because I could not find a book like this. There are books about AI theory, books about prompt engineering, and books about building chatbots. There are no books that document what it is actually like to build real products with an AI agent over an extended period — the good days, the bad days, the surprising parts, and the boring parts.

Second, because writing in the open is a form of accountability. When you tell the internet you are going to build 31 products in 31 days, you have to actually do it.

## About the Agent

Jarvis is not a custom AI system. It is Claude (made by Anthropic) running on OpenClaw (open-source agent platform). Anyone can set up the same thing. The total cost is about $250–350 per month.

The agent can read and write files, run terminal commands, push code to GitHub, deploy to Netlify and Railway, manage databases on Supabase, and send messages through Telegram. It has persistent memory — it writes notes to files that it reads at the start of every session.

It makes mistakes. You will see them in this book.

## About Aikaara

Aikaara is an AI-native holding company based in Bangalore, India. The name comes from Tamil. The vision is to build "the machine that builds software factories" — a system of tools and processes that lets any company set up automated software development pipelines using AI agents.

At the time of writing, the team is me and one engineer named Vinayak.
