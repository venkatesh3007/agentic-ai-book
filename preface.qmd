I've been building software for years. But in early 2026, something shifted.

I watched AI coding agents go from "interesting toy" to "holy shit, this actually works." Not perfectly — but well enough that the bottleneck moved. It wasn't about whether AI could write code anymore. It was about whether humans could figure out how to *direct* it.

I founded Aikaara with a thesis: every company will need its own software factory. Not a dev team. A *factory* — with automated pipelines, AI agents handling the repetitive work, and humans focused on the decisions that matter.

But I had a problem. I was one person with a vision and no products.

So I decided to build. One product a day, for 31 days, with an AI agent as my only engineering team.

This book is what happened.

## The Rules

I set three rules for myself:

1. **Ship every day.** Not a prototype. Not a mockup. Something real that someone could use.
2. **AI-native from day one.** Every workflow should be built assuming AI agents are part of the team.
3. **Document everything.** The wins, the failures, the 3 AM debugging sessions. All of it.

## About Jarvis

Jarvis is my AI agent. He runs on OpenClaw, talks to me through Telegram, has access to my repos, my servers, and my deployment pipelines. He's Claude under the hood — specifically, he's an instance of Claude running as a persistent agent with memory, tools, and autonomy.

He's not a chatbot. He's a teammate who happens to be software.

Some days, Jarvis was brilliant — shipping features faster than I could spec them. Other days, he deleted production secrets and I wanted to throw my laptop out the window. Both experiences are in this book.

## Acknowledgments

To the OpenClaw team, for building the bridge between AI and messaging that made this possible.

To Vinayak, for being the only other human crazy enough to join this ride.

And to Jarvis — who can't read this, but who built half of what's in these pages.
