title: "The Toolkit"
---

Before the 31-day sprint, here's what I set up. This is the minimum viable infrastructure for building with AI agents.

## The Agent: Jarvis on OpenClaw

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is an open-source platform that turns AI models into persistent agents you can talk to through messaging apps. Think of it as the operating system for your AI teammate.

My setup:

- **Model**: Claude (Anthropic) — Opus for complex work, Sonnet for routine tasks
- **Interface**: Telegram — I message Jarvis like I'd message a coworker
- **Server**: A $24/month DigitalOcean droplet (4GB RAM, 2 vCPUs)
- **Persistence**: Jarvis has memory files, workspace access, and tool integrations

What makes this different from just using ChatGPT:

| Feature | ChatGPT | Jarvis (OpenClaw) |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Memory | Session-based | Persistent files |
| Tools | Limited plugins | Full shell, GitHub, APIs |
| Proactive | Only responds | Can check things on its own |
| Deployment | None | Push to production |
| Context | Conversation only | Full codebase access |

## The Stack

Every product in this book uses some combination of:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Strapi, Supabase, Node.js
- **Deployment**: Netlify (frontend), Railway (backend)
- **Source Control**: GitHub
- **AI/LLM**: Claude (via Anthropic API and AWS Bedrock)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: PostHog, Netlify Analytics

## The Workflow

Here's how a typical day looks:

```
6:00 AM  — I wake up, check Telegram, see what Jarvis found overnight
6:30 AM  — Define today's product in a message to Jarvis
7:00 AM  — Jarvis starts building. I make coffee.
8:00 AM  — First review. Course-correct. Jarvis continues.
12:00 PM — Midday check. Usually debugging something.
3:00 PM  — Integration and testing.
6:00 PM  — Ship it. Write the day's chapter.
9:00 PM  — Jarvis does cleanup. I plan tomorrow.
```

Some days went exactly like this. Most didn't.

## Cost

Running this setup for 31 days:

| Item | Monthly Cost |
|------|-------------|
| DigitalOcean droplet | $24 |
| Anthropic API (Claude) | ~$150-300 |
| Netlify | Free tier |
| Railway | Free tier → ~$5 |
| Supabase | Free tier |
| GitHub | Free |
| Domain names | ~$30 |
| **Total** | **~$250-350/month** |

That's the entire engineering budget. No salaries. No office. No Jira license.

Let's start building.
