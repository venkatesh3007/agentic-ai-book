title: "Building ChatSite"
subtitle: "February 21, 2026 — A full product in one evening"

The same day I set up Jarvis, I decided to test its limits. Could it build a complete product — not a toy, but something a real business could use — in a single session?

The product: ChatSite. A system that lets small business owners manage their website by chatting on WhatsApp or Telegram. Instead of logging into a CMS dashboard, you message your AI agent: "Update the price of Cinema Tower 500 to ₹90,000." The agent updates the CMS, the website rebuilds, and the change is live.

The first implementation is for AMP Loudspeakers, a premium home cinema speaker company in Mumbai.

## The Spec

I wrote the spec as a PDF document. Fifteen pages covering:

- Architecture (OpenClaw → Strapi CMS → Next.js frontend)
- Five content types (Site Settings, Products, Pages, Announcements, Enquiries)
- The OpenClaw skill that translates natural language to API calls
- The Next.js frontend with product pages, enquiry forms, and SEO
- Deployment setup (Netlify for frontend, Railway for Strapi)

I sent the PDF to Jarvis on Telegram.

## The Sub-Agent Approach

Jarvis decided to split the work. It spawned two sub-agents running in parallel:

- One to scaffold and configure the Strapi backend with all five content types
- One to build the Next.js frontend with all pages and components

This was the first time I saw the agent delegate work to other agents. It happened without me asking for it.

*[To be expanded with real details of what each sub-agent did, what went wrong, and how long it took.]*

## What Went Wrong

Several things:

1. The sub-agents produced code with mismatched types. The Strapi schema used field names like `email` and `phone`, but the frontend expected `contactEmail` and `contactPhone`. Jarvis had to fix the alignment manually.

2. The frontend build failed because of a Tailwind CSS class (`border-border`) that does not exist in Tailwind v4. The sub-agent had copied a pattern from shadcn/ui without checking compatibility.

3. The Strapi deployment to Railway crashed because the `pg` (PostgreSQL) driver was not in the package dependencies. Strapi was scaffolded with SQLite by default.

4. Updating the npm lockfile required more memory than the 4GB server had. The `npm install` process was killed by the OS.

*[Each failure will be described in detail with the exact error messages and how they were resolved.]*

## The Result

Repository: [venkatesh3007/chatsite](https://github.com/venkatesh3007/chatsite)

By the end of the session:

- ✅ Strapi backend with all 5 content types (schemas matching the spec exactly)
- ✅ Next.js frontend building successfully (11 static pages)
- ✅ OpenClaw skill written (SKILL.md with API patterns and behavior rules)
- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub
- 🔄 Railway deployment in progress (Strapi backend)
- ✅ Seed script with placeholder AMP Loudspeakers data

The frontend builds with fallback data when Strapi is not connected, so the site works even before the backend is deployed.

## What This Taught Me

**Building is not shipping.** ChatSite was fully built in one day — 39 files, complete frontend and backend, working locally. But it's still not deployed for the target user.

The problem isn't technical. The deployment works. The issue is that the target audience (small business owners managing AMP Loudspeakers' website) would need technical knowledge to:

- Set up WhatsApp Business API credentials
- Configure Railway for the Strapi backend  
- Connect the OpenClaw skill to their messaging
- Manage environment variables across services

The product assumes a level of technical comfort that the users don't have. I built something sophisticated that only developers can deploy.

This is a common pattern with AI-generated products: they solve the coding problem but not the adoption problem. The AI can build complex systems, but it doesn't simplify them for end users.

**ChatSite remains incomplete** — not because the code doesn't work, but because the deployment is too complex for the people who would benefit from it.

This became another idea for the March sprint: how to build products that deploy themselves, requiring no technical configuration from users.

**Sub-agent coordination works.** Jarvis successfully delegated work to specialized sub-agents and coordinated their output. This pattern will be crucial for building multiple products simultaneously during the sprint.

**Type mismatches are inevitable** when different agents build different parts of the same system. This problem shows up again in Chapter 7 with the Secure Sleuths deployment.
