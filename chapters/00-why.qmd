title: "Why a Software Factory?"

## The Thesis

Here's what I believe: in five years, every mid-size company will have its own software factory. Not an outsourced dev team. Not a no-code tool. A *factory* — an automated system that takes business requirements and produces working software.

The analogy is manufacturing. Before the assembly line, making a car was artisanal. Skilled craftsmen hand-built every part. It was slow, expensive, and didn't scale.

Then Ford figured out the assembly line. The car didn't change. The *process* of making cars changed.

Software is at that inflection point right now.

## The Assembly Line for Software

```
Spec → Decompose → Dispatch → Build → QA → Merge → Ship
```

Each stage can be partially or fully automated with AI agents:

- **Spec**: Human writes what they want (or AI helps refine it)
- **Decompose**: AI breaks the spec into agent-sized tasks
- **Dispatch**: Tasks are assigned to parallel AI agents
- **Build**: Agents write the code
- **QA**: AI reviews the output against the spec
- **Merge**: AI handles integration and conflict resolution
- **Ship**: Automated deployment

No single AI agent can do all of this. But a *system* of agents, each handling one stage, can.

That's a software factory.

## Why Now?

Three things converged in 2025-2026:

1. **AI coding agents got good enough.** Not perfect — but good enough to handle well-scoped tasks autonomously.
2. **Orchestration tools matured.** Tools like OpenClaw, Claude Code, and Cursor made it possible to give agents real access to real systems.
3. **The economics flipped.** An AI agent costs $0.05-$2.00 per task. A developer costs $50-$200/hour. For routine work, the math is obvious.

## What Aikaara Is

Aikaara is the company I'm building to make this real. The name comes from the Tamil word ஐகாரா — it means "the one who creates."

The vision: **the machine that builds software factories.**

Every company's factory will be different — different tech stack, different conventions, different business logic. But the *meta-process* of building a factory is the same. That's what Aikaara productizes.

This book is the story of building the first factory — ours.
