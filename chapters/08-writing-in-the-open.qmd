subtitle: "February 25–26, 2026 — Setting up this book"

This chapter is meta. It describes how this book is written, why it is open-source, and how the writing process itself uses AI agents.

## Why Open Source

The book is free to read on GitHub. The full source is at [venkatesh3007/agentic-ai-book](https://github.com/venkatesh3007/agentic-ai-book).

The reasoning:

1. **Credibility.** Anyone can verify the claims in this book by checking the commit history. The timestamps, the code changes, and the deployment logs are all public.

2. **Audience building.** The book is a marketing asset. Each chapter can be shared on Twitter, Hacker News, and Indie Hackers. Readers who find value in the free version may buy the formatted Kindle edition.

3. **Feedback.** Open-source books get pull requests. Readers fix typos, suggest improvements, and point out errors. This makes the book better than I could make it alone.

## The Toolchain

The book is written in Quarto, an open-source publishing system. The source files are Markdown with some extra formatting. From the same source, Quarto generates:

- **HTML** — The free website at [venkatesh3007.github.io/agentic-ai-book](https://venkatesh3007.github.io/agentic-ai-book/)
- **PDF** — Formatted for KDP (Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing) print edition
- **EPUB** — For Kindle ebook

Every push to the `main` branch triggers a GitHub Action that rebuilds the website automatically.

## How the Writing Works

The writing process uses the same AI agent that builds the products:

1. We build something during the day
2. The agent has a record of everything that happened (commands run, errors hit, decisions made)
3. I ask the agent to draft the chapter based on what actually happened
4. I edit the draft for voice, accuracy, and structure
5. We push to GitHub

The agent writes clear descriptions of technical events. I add the human perspective — why I made certain choices, what I was thinking, what I felt when things broke.

## The Business Model

- **Free:** Full book content on GitHub and the website
- **Paid:** Formatted Kindle ebook and paperback on Amazon KDP
- **License:** Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 (free to share, no commercial use without permission)

The precedent for this model is "You Don't Know JS" by Kyle Simpson (180k+ GitHub stars, published through O'Reilly) and "The JavaScript Way" by Baptiste Pesquet (topped GitHub trending charts at launch with no initial audience).
