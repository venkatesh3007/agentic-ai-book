This chapter lists every tool I used, how much it costs, and why I chose it. If you want to follow along with the 31-day sprint, this is your shopping list.

## The Agent Platform: OpenClaw

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is open-source software that turns an AI model into a persistent agent. It runs on your own server and connects to messaging apps.

What OpenClaw provides:

- **Messaging bridge.** Connects the AI to Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, Discord, and others. You message the agent like you would message a person.
- **Tool access.** The agent can run shell commands, read and write files, browse the web, and call APIs.
- **Memory.** The agent has persistent files it can read and write. These survive across conversations.
- **Skills.** Modular instruction sets that teach the agent how to do specific things (check weather, manage GitHub issues, control smart home devices).
- **Sub-agents.** The agent can spawn separate sessions to handle tasks in parallel.
- **Cron jobs.** The agent can schedule tasks to run at specific times.

OpenClaw is free. You need a server to run it on and an API key from an AI provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.).

**Installation:** Follow the instructions at [docs.openclaw.ai](https://docs.openclaw.ai). The basic setup takes about 30 minutes.

## The AI Model: Claude by Anthropic

I use Claude as the language model behind Jarvis. Specifically:

- **Claude Opus** for complex tasks (debugging, architecture decisions, writing)
- **Claude Sonnet** for routine tasks (scaffolding, simple fixes, sub-agent work)

I initially bought $25 of Anthropic API credits and started using them directly. Within 15 minutes of real agent work, I had burned through $6–7. The API also has very low rate limits for new accounts — the agent would get throttled after a few back-to-back tasks.

So I switched to my Claude Code Max subscription ($200/month). This gives higher rate limits and more predictable costs. It still hits rate limits sometimes after 4–5 consecutive heavy tasks, but it recovers after a short cooldown period. For sustained agent work, a subscription plan is more practical than pay-per-token API credits.

You could use a different model. OpenClaw supports OpenAI (GPT-4), Google (Gemini), DeepSeek, and local models. I chose Claude because it is the best at following complex instructions and working with code, based on my testing.

## The Server

A DigitalOcean droplet:

- **Size:** 2 vCPUs, 4GB RAM
- **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04
- **Cost:** $24/month
- **Location:** Bangalore (BLR1) — close to me for low latency

This is enough to run OpenClaw and basic development tasks. It is not enough to run heavy builds — the server runs out of memory when installing large npm packages. For heavy builds, I use cloud services (Netlify, Railway) or spawn build tasks on more powerful machines.

## Source Control: GitHub

All code lives on GitHub under the account `venkatesh3007`. Every product built during the sprint gets its own repository.

The agent authenticates using a personal access token and can clone, commit, push, create pull requests, and manage issues.

## Frontend Deployment: Netlify

Netlify hosts the static frontends. Free tier covers everything I need:

- Automatic deploys from GitHub pushes
- Custom domain support
- Serverless functions
- Environment variable management

The main constraint is the 4KB environment variable limit on serverless functions, which we hit on Day 1.

## Backend Deployment: Railway

Railway hosts backend services (APIs, databases, CMS). It deploys from GitHub and provides:

- PostgreSQL databases
- Automatic builds from Dockerfiles or Nixpacks
- Environment variable management
- Public domains

Free tier gives $5/month of usage. Paid tier starts at $5/month for hobby use.

## Database: Supabase

Supabase provides managed PostgreSQL databases with a REST API, authentication, and real-time subscriptions.

Free tier includes:

- 500MB database
- 50,000 monthly active users
- 2GB file storage
- Unlimited API requests

For the products in this book, the free tier is sufficient.

## The Full Cost

| Item | Monthly Cost |
|------|-------------|
| DigitalOcean droplet (OpenClaw server) | $24 |
| Claude Code Max subscription | $200 |
| Netlify | Free |
| Railway | $0–5 |
| Supabase | Free |
| GitHub | Free |
| Domain names | ~$10–30 |
| **Total** | **~$260/month** |

This is the entire engineering budget for running the agent. There are no developer salaries, no office costs, no software licenses beyond what is listed here.

## What You Need to Follow Along

If you want to build along with this book:

1. A server (any VPS with 2+ GB RAM — DigitalOcean, Hetzner, AWS Lightsail)
2. An Anthropic API key (sign up at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com))
3. A GitHub account
4. A Netlify account
5. A Telegram account (for messaging the agent)

Total setup time: about two hours. Total cost to start: about $225 (server + Claude Code Max subscription). If you use pay-per-token API credits instead, be aware that agent work burns through tokens fast — I spent $6–7 in the first 15 minutes on a $25 credit purchase.
