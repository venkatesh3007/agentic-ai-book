This chapter lists every tool I used, how much it costs, and why I chose it. If you want to follow along with the 31-day sprint, this is your shopping list.

## The Agent Platform: OpenClaw

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is open-source software that turns an AI model into a persistent agent. It runs on your own server and connects to messaging apps.

What OpenClaw provides:

- **Messaging bridge.** Connects the AI to Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, Discord, and others. You message the agent like you would message a person.
- **Tool access.** The agent can run shell commands, read and write files, browse the web, and call APIs.
- **Memory.** The agent has persistent files it can read and write. These survive across conversations.
- **Skills.** Modular instruction sets that teach the agent how to do specific things (check weather, manage GitHub issues, control smart home devices).
- **Sub-agents.** The agent can spawn separate sessions to handle tasks in parallel.
- **Cron jobs.** The agent can schedule tasks to run at specific times.

OpenClaw is free. You need a server to run it on and an API key from an AI provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.).

**Installation:** Follow the instructions at [docs.openclaw.ai](https://docs.openclaw.ai). The basic setup takes about 30 minutes.

## The AI Model: Claude by Anthropic

I use Claude as the language model behind Jarvis. Specifically:

- **Claude Opus** for complex tasks (debugging, architecture decisions, writing)
- **Claude Sonnet** for routine tasks (scaffolding, simple fixes, sub-agent work)

Opus costs about $15 per million input tokens and $75 per million output tokens. Sonnet costs $3 and $15 respectively. In practice, a full day of heavy agent usage costs $5–15 in API calls.

You could use a different model. OpenClaw supports OpenAI (GPT-4), Google (Gemini), DeepSeek, and local models. I chose Claude because it is the best at following complex instructions and working with code, based on my testing.

## The Server

A DigitalOcean droplet:

- **Size:** 2 vCPUs, 4GB RAM
- **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04
- **Cost:** $24/month
- **Location:** Bangalore (BLR1) — close to me for low latency

This is enough to run OpenClaw and basic development tasks. It is not enough to run heavy builds — the server runs out of memory when installing large npm packages. For heavy builds, I use cloud services (Netlify, Railway) or spawn build tasks on more powerful machines.

## Source Control: GitHub

All code lives on GitHub under the account `venkatesh3007`. Every product built during the sprint gets its own repository.

The agent authenticates using a personal access token and can clone, commit, push, create pull requests, and manage issues.

## Frontend Deployment: Netlify

Netlify hosts the static frontends. Free tier covers everything I need:

- Automatic deploys from GitHub pushes
- Custom domain support
- Serverless functions
- Environment variable management

The main constraint is the 4KB environment variable limit on serverless functions, which we hit on Day 1.

## Backend Deployment: Railway

Railway hosts backend services (APIs, databases, CMS). It deploys from GitHub and provides:

- PostgreSQL databases
- Automatic builds from Dockerfiles or Nixpacks
- Environment variable management
- Public domains

Free tier gives $5/month of usage. Paid tier starts at $5/month for hobby use.

## Database: Supabase

Supabase provides managed PostgreSQL databases with a REST API, authentication, and real-time subscriptions.

Free tier includes:

- 500MB database
- 50,000 monthly active users
- 2GB file storage
- Unlimited API requests

For the products in this book, the free tier is sufficient.

## The Full Cost

| Item | Monthly Cost |
|------|-------------|
| DigitalOcean droplet (OpenClaw server) | $24 |
| Anthropic API (Claude) | $150–300 |
| Netlify | Free |
| Railway | $0–5 |
| Supabase | Free |
| GitHub | Free |
| Domain names | ~$10–30 |
| **Total** | **$200–360/month** |

This is the entire engineering budget. There are no developer salaries, no office costs, no software licenses.

The Anthropic API cost is the largest expense and the most variable. Heavy debugging days with Opus cost more. Routine scaffolding days with Sonnet cost less.

## What You Need to Follow Along

If you want to build along with this book:

1. A server (any VPS with 2+ GB RAM — DigitalOcean, Hetzner, AWS Lightsail)
2. An Anthropic API key (sign up at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com))
3. A GitHub account
4. A Netlify account
5. A Telegram account (for messaging the agent)

Total setup time: about two hours. Total cost to start: about $30 (server + first day of API usage).
