title: "Planning the Sprint"
subtitle: "February 27–28, 2026 — Choosing 31 products to build"
---

On March 1, the 31-day sprint begins. This chapter describes how I chose what to build.

## The Criteria

Each product must:

1. **Ship in one day.** It has to be usable by the end of the day. Not perfect, but functional.
2. **Be real.** Not a demo, not a prototype. Something a person or business could actually use.
3. **Teach something.** Each product should exercise a different aspect of building with AI agents.
4. **Build toward the factory.** The products should collectively form the building blocks of Aikaara's software factory.

## The Product List

*[To be finalized by February 28. Will include 31 products spanning:]*

**Developer tools** (from the software-factory roadmap):
- spec-to-tasks — Break specs into agent-sized tasks
- agent-eval — Evaluate agent-generated code
- convention-keeper — Extract and enforce codebase conventions
- context-pack — Assemble minimal context for agents

**Business websites** (from the ChatSite template):
- Websites for real businesses using the ChatSite framework
- Each one customized for a different business type

**Internal tools:**
- Dashboard for tracking agent performance
- Cost tracker for API usage
- Deployment pipeline automation

**Open-source utilities:**
- Small, useful tools that solve specific problems
- Each one a standalone npm package or CLI tool

## The Schedule

- **Week 1 (March 1–7):** Foundation tools and first websites
- **Week 2 (March 8–14):** Developer tools from the factory roadmap
- **Week 3 (March 15–21):** Business products and integrations
- **Week 4 (March 22–28):** Factory infrastructure and connecting the pieces
- **Days 29–31 (March 29–31):** Polish, documentation, and the factory demo

## The Rules

1. One product per day. No carrying over work to the next day.
2. Every product gets pushed to GitHub before midnight IST.
3. Every product gets a chapter in this book.
4. Jarvis does the building. I do the directing and writing.
5. Failures are documented. There is no hiding bad days.

*[This chapter will be updated with the finalized product list before March 1.]*
