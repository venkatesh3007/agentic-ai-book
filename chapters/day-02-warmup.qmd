## Product: Research & Discovery
**Date**: February 22, 2026 (Sunday)
**Focus**: Peter Steinberger's "Shipping at Inference Speed" methodology
**Status**: ✅ Foundation discovered

## The Goal

Sometimes the most productive day is one where you don't build anything at all. Sunday was for research — digging into how others are already doing what I'm trying to do.

## 10:00 AM — The Peter Trail

I'd been hearing about Peter Steinberger (@steipete) and his "factory approach" to building with AI. He's the creator of OpenClaw, but I needed to understand his methodology — not just his tools.

Jarvis helped me track down the key article: ["Shipping at Inference Speed"](https://steipete.me/posts/2025/shipping-at-inference-speed). Reading it was like finding the blueprint I'd been looking for.

## The Evolution

Peter's journey mapped perfectly to where I want to go:

**May 2025**: Started with "vibe coding" — casual AI assistance  
**Mid 2025**: GPT-5 unlock → serious daily building with AI  
**Late 2025**: "Building like a factory" — systematic approach emerges  
**Early 2026**: Clawdis (his personal AI assistant setup)  
**Now**: OpenClaw (productized version for everyone)  

## The Factory Philosophy

Peter's core insight: **"Shipping at inference speed"**

His rules became my rules:
- **CLI first**: "Whatever you build, start with the model and a CLI first"
- **Multiple projects**: Build 3-8 things simultaneously  
- **Queue ideas**: Let AI models churn through them
- **Commit to main**: No branches, just ship
- **Cross-pollinate**: Reference patterns across projects

## The Infrastructure

What caught my attention: Peter didn't just build products. He built infrastructure that compounds:
- **Oracle**: GPT query system
- **VibeTunnel**: Mobile coding environment  
- **Domain CLIs**: Tools for every aspect of his work
- **Home automation**: AI integrated into daily life

## The Lesson

**Study the masters, then adapt their methods.**

Peter proved that daily AI-assisted building isn't just possible — it's how you stay ahead. The competitive advantage comes from infrastructure that compounds daily effort into systematic capability.

His approach will inform everything I build in the 31-day sprint.

## Sunday Evening Plan

Spent the evening updating my mental model:
- **March 1-31**: Not just 31 products, but 31 experiments in factory building
- **Focus**: Infrastructure that enables faster building, not just individual tools
- **Method**: Peter's principles + my own domain knowledge

Tomorrow: Start building the infrastructure.
